# To implement the described API client for the USPTO Data Set API, we'll create a structure with three main classes corresponding to the three endpoints described. Each class will be responsible for handling the requests and responses for its respective endpoint. We'll use `aiohttp` for asynchronous HTTP requests.

### Directory Structure

# - api/
#   - client/
#     - __init__.py
#     - metadata.py
#     - search.py

### Implementation

#### 1. Base Client

# First, let's create a base client that will be used by other classes for making HTTP requests.


# filename: api/client/base_client.py
import aiohttp

class BaseClient:
    BASE_URL = "http://example.com"  # Placeholder URL, replace with actual USPTO API base URL

    async def get(self, path):
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(f"{self.BASE_URL}{path}") as response:
                return await response.json()

    async def post(self, path, data):
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.post(f"{self.BASE_URL}{path}", json=data) as response:
                return await response.json()
